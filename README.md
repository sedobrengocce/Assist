## Contributing

### Issue tracker

Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sedobrengocce/Assist/issues) to discuss potential improvements you want to make
before sending a Pull Request.

The Issue Tracker may contain items labelled **help wanted** or **good first issue**
from time to time. This is a good place to look if you want to contribute but aren't sure where to start.

### Pull Requests

We use [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for external contributions. Code must be well-tested and not decrease the test coverage significantly.

#### Use a separate branch (not `master`)

Please commit changes to a separate branch in your fork
so that we can work together making changes to it before it
is ready to be merged. Name your branch something like
`<username>/feature`.

Once you are ready, you can create a Pull Request for it to be
merged into the `master` branch in this repo.

#### Testing

The following commands must pass for a Pull Request to be considered:

``` bash
# run all tests
$ npm test

# code lint
$ npm run lint
```
